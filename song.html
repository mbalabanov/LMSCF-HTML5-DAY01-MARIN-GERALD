<h1>The Scientist</h1>
<h2>Coldplay</h2>

<p>Come up to meet you<br>
Tell you I'm sorry<br>
You don't know how lovely you are<br>
I had to find you<br>
Tell you I need you<br>
Tell you I set you apart</p>

<p>Tell me your secrets<br>
And ask me your questions<br>
Oh let's go back to the start<br>
Running in circles, coming up tails<br>
Heads on a science apart</p>

<p>Nobody said it was easy<br>
It's such a shame for us to part<br>
Nobody said it was easy<br>
No one ever said it would be this hard<br>
Oh take me back to the start</p>

<p>I was just guessing at numbers and figures<br>
Pulling your puzzles apart<br>
Questions of science, science and progress<br>
Do not speak as loud as my heart</p>

<p>Tell me you love me<br>
Come back and haunt me<br>
Oh and I rush to the start<br>
Running in circles, chasing our tails<br>
Coming back as we are</p>

<p>Nobody said it was easy<br>
Oh it's such a shame for us to part<br>
Nobody said it was easy<br>
No one ever said it would be so hard<br>
I'm going back to the start<br>
